function [obj] = manageConstraints(obj, obstacle)
% manageConstraints - verify the restrictions of all constraints by
% checking whether their limitation has been violated. If the actual
% property is higher than the constraint, it gets increased.
%
% Syntax:
%   [obj] = manageConstraints(obj, obstacle)
%
% Inputs:
%   obj - Occupancy object (property of obstacle)
%   obstacle - Obstacle object
%
% Outputs:
%   obj - Occupancy object
%
% Other m-files required: none
% Subfunctions: none
% MAT-files required: none
